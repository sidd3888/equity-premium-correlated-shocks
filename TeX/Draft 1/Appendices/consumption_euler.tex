\subsection{Approximating the consumption Euler equation}

The consumption Euler equation is given by:
\[
1 = \b\E\bs{\Rc_{t+1}\bp{\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_{t}}}^{-\rho}}
\]

\begin{align*}
    \ln\b + \ln\Rc_{t+1} - \rho\bp{\ln C_{t+1} - \ln C_{t}}
\end{align*}
The log-linearized form of this equation is:
\[
\rho\E_{t}\bs{\D\ln C_{t+1}} = \E_{t}\bs{\ln(\Rc_{t+1})} + \ln\b + \frac{\rho}{2}\text{Var}\bp{\D\ln C_{t+1}}
\]
