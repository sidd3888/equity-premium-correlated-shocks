In a consumption-based asset pricing model with a generalized disappointment-averse investor and small, IID consumption shocks, this feature results in a realistic equity premium despite low risk aversion. The model is consistent with the main facts about stock market risk premiums inferred from equity index options, remains tightly parameterized, and allows for analytical solutions for asset prices. An extension with non-IID dynamics accounts for excess volatility and return predictability, while preserving the model’s consistency with option moments.},

Under CRRA time additive utility, habit persistence utility, and for a broad range of parameterizations, the model predicts that investors wish to borrow and invest all of their savings in stocks. This qualitative implication is robust to the introduction of significant transaction costs in the stock market, and contrasts sharply with portfolio allocation models in which there is no labor income.},

Households with low risk aversion smooth earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most of them (optimally) never invest in equities.

We document substantial heterogeneity in financial market expectations. Expectations are correlated with stock ownership.

We show that the key variables found to be positive predictors of actual stock returns in the asset-pricing literature are also highly correlated with investor's subjective expected returns, but with the opposite sign. Moreover, our analysis of the microdata indicates that subjective expectations of both risk and returns on stocks are strongly influenced by perceptions of economic conditions. In particular, when investors believe macroeconomic conditions are more expansionary, they tend to expect both higher returns and lower volatility. This is difficult to reconcile with the canonical view that expected returns on stocks rise during recessions to compensate household investors for increased exposure or sensitivity to macroeconomic risks. Finally, the relevance of these investors' subjective expectations is supported by the finding of a significant link between their expectations and portfolio choices. In particular, we show that portfolio equity positions tend to be higher for those respondents that anticipate higher expected returns or lower uncertainty.},

The unconstrained and constrained behavior when borrowing limits are based on labor income or on asset holdings of the household are compared, and the effects of varying the tightness of such limits are examined. Credit market conditions, as reflected in the tightness of borrowing constraints, can have serious effects on portfolio composition. Constraints can reduce or eliminate effects of earnings risk on wealth holdings. They can also reverse effects of risk aversion and of earnings risk on stockholding relative to those predicted by models that abstract from such constraints. As a result, samples contaminated with borrowing-constrained households will tend to underplay or even reverse the impact of risk aversion and of earnings risk expected on the basis of unconstrained models. The analysis suggests caution in basing sample splits on observed asset holdings, and in interpreting the failure of empirical studies to uncover sizeable precautionary effects on wealth and on portfolios.},
